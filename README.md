# Robot-Simulation

Robot simulation is a repo where all my projects using Gazebo and Webots are present on different branches

# Branches Explained

1.Master Branch: This baranch contains all the information required to access the code on my simulation work and How to Run the code. I will keep updating how to run the code for each project and which file is the main file for running all the necessery functions.
2.Webots Beginners Branch: This branch contains all my program's to create a Differential Drive Robot using WEBOTS simulation software. It contails the following files

  i. The wbt file of my robot and its Environment 
 ii. The Robot controller Program in Python to make the robot move in different polygonial patterns   
iii. The Odometry files of the robot, These files uses rotery Encoder to count the revolutions of the robot and hence it uses those revolutions to calculate the Distance traveled by the robot.
